- content negotiation for Index
- implement delete all
- makes sure the id in matches id out on put
- switch the querystrings to use json so filtering and sorting can be added
- implement looking up by dates
- add readonly mode
	unavailable methods: 501 not implmented or 405 method not allowed?
- implement tests
	tests are out for now, don't know how to mock the database and web server

DONE:
- content negotiation for Find
- make test script
- add content-type handling for posts and puts
- apparently PUT should be an upsert not an insert (believe PUT should also fully replace the document, not just partially updated it -- verify)
- add basic type handling to querying
- add more complex methods
	* implemented find with simple querystring
- implement looking up by numbers
- figure out how to eliminate the struct required for decoding objects
- add content-type sending and accept receiving
- better error handling
- patch rest.go and send it in
- add all basic methods
- figure out how to make it generic
- turn from program to library
